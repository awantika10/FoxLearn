The idea evaluates the role and the possibility of virtual practical teaching using AR -VR  template by by creating an immersive and interactive learning experience without the use of textbooks. AR and VR technology empowers learners to explore and learn at their own pace, thus stimulating learning and comprehension and enhances critical retention.
Without having to step out of the classroom or their home, students are exposed to completely new and active learning environments. Teachers could teach subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, and Biology through virtual labs that not just keeps students engaged but also allows them to practice before they can test the experiments in real laboratories.
